.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm stat161
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm stat161
program prints hardware counters from a running System/161 process.
If no such process is running in the current directory,
.Nm stat161
waits until one starts, polling once per second.
If the System/161 process exits,
.Nm stat161
disconnects from it and waits for another to start.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sys161 1
.Sh BUGS
The set of counters printed and the print interval are fixed.
The print interval depends on the internal timing of System/161 and
may thus vary depending on workload.
