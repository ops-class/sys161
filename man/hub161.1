.Sh NAME
.Nm hub161
.Nd System/161 local interconnect
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm hub161
.Op Ar sockname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm hub161
program connects multiple local System/161 instances through their
network devices.
Each System/161 instance's network device should be configured to
point to the
.Nm hub161
socket using the
.Li hub=
configuration directive in
.Pa sys161.conf .
Once started,
.Nm hub161
receives packets from connected System/161 instances and retransmits
them to all other connected System/161 instances.
A link-level keepalive protocol is used to track what connected
instances exist.
.Pp
The optional
.Ar sockname
argument sets the socket path.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width .sockets/hub -compact
.It Pa .sockets/hub
The default socket path.

.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm hub161
program is a hub, not a switch; it forwards every packet to every
connected instance and makes no attempt to dispatch packets
selectively based on host addresses.
