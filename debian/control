Description: System/161 Simulator
 System/161 is a machine simulator that provides a simplified but still
 realistic environment for OS hacking. It is a 32-bit MIPS system supporting up
 to 32 processors, with up to 31 hardware slots each holding a single simple
 device (disk, console, network, etc.) It was designed to support OS/161, with a
 balance of simplicity and realism chosen to make it maximally useful for
 teaching. However, it also has proven useful as a platform for rapid
 development of research kernel projects.
