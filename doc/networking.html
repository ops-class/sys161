Network Connectivity with <tt>hub161</tt>
</font></h2>

<p>
If you are using the <A HREF=devices.html#nic>network card</A>, you
need to use the <tt>hub161</tt> program to provide a simulated network
for the card to plug into.
</p>

<p>
When you run <tt>hub161</tt>, you can optionally give it, on its
command line, the name of a Unix-domain socket to listen to. The
default is <tt>.sockets/hub</tt>. This pathname may then be specified
in the <tt>sys161.conf</tt> file(s) of the system(s) that wish to
connect to that hub.
</p>

<p>
Each socket can only have one hub running on it at a time; however,
you can have as many hubs as you like at once by giving them different
socket names.
</p>

<p>
If you give the cards plugged into the same hub duplicate hardware
addresses, bizarre things will happen.
</p>

<p>
No facility is provided for gatewaying <tt>hub161</tt> packets onto
the real network via the host system. Such a facility could be
written, albeit with some difficulty, but will be fairly useless
unless the operating system running within System/161 contains its own
complete TCP/IP implementation.
</p>

<p>
The simulated network is a very simple link layer. All packets are
sent to the hub process, which rebroadcasts them to all network cards.
There is very little attempt at realism in general.
</p>

<p>
There is no effort made to synchronize the time among multiple
instances of System/161 connected to the same hub; thus, packets may
appear to travel in time. Furthermore, because of the way System/161
handles time, any attempt to synchronize the time in software is
likely doomed to failure.
</p>

<p>
Because <tt>hub161</tt> communicates over Unix-domain sockets, it and
all the instances of <tt>sys161</tt> or <tt>trace161</tt> that wish to
connect to it must be run on the same host.
</p>

<p>
It should not be necessary to restart <tt>hub161</tt> if any of the
<tt>sys161</tt> processes attached to it die, or vice-versa either,
although a delay of up to a few seconds on a busy host system may
occur. 
</p>

<p>
If you are not using the network, it is recommended that you comment
the network devices out of <tt>sys161.conf</tt> to reduce overhead on
the host system.
