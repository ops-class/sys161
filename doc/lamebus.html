Linear Always-Mapped Extents
</font></h2>

<p>
LAMEbus is a simple no-fuss system bus architecture. There are 32
slots, each of which is associated with a fixed-size addressable
region. These regions are mapped in order into the system physical
memory space. There is no DMA; data transfers are done by the CPU
using transfer buffers appearing within a device's address space.
(However, DMA may be added in a future version.)
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Structure of the Bus
Region</font></h3>

<p>
There are 32 slots, and each slot has a 64K address space. Thus, the
whole bus region takes 64K*32 = 2MB. The base physical address of this
region is called LAMEBASE; because different processor types impose
different restrictions on the organization of physical memory, its
value depends on the processor architecture.
</p>

<p>
The bus controller always appears in slot 31; its 64K address space is
divided in two.
The lower half is divided into 32 1K config regions, one per slot.
The upper half is divided into 32 1K control regions, one per CPU.
In addition to configuration, the config region of the bus
controller's config region contains the bus controller's own
registers, described below.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Addressing the Bus</font></h3>

<p>
Thus, the <em>physical</em> address for slot <tt>N</tt>, holding the
registers and other material for the device placed the slot, is given
by
<pre>
	LAMEBASE + (0x10000*N)
</pre>
The physical address for slot <tt>N</tt>'s config region is given by
<pre>
	LAMEBASE + (0x10000*31) + (0x400*N)
</pre>
The physical address for CPU <tt>N</tt>'s control region is given by
<pre>
	LAMEBASE + (0x10000*31) + 0x8000 + (0x400*N)
</pre>
Virtual addresses will of course vary depending on processor
architecture and MMU state.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Physical Memory Layout</font></h3>

<p><b>MIPS.</b></p>

<p>
On 32-bit MIPS processors, the first 512 megabytes of the physical
address space is hardwired to appear at kernel virtual addresses
0x8000 0000 (cached) and 0xA000 0000 (uncached).
Also, several virtual addresses starting at 0xbfc0 0000 are hardwired
into the architecture and must point into the firmware ROM.
</p>

<p>
For this reason, LAMEBASE is set to 0x1fe0 0000, so the LAMEbus mapping
area appears at the top end of these regions. The physical memory map
is as follows:
<table width=100%>

<p>
Because the MIPS has a 32-bit memory bus, all registers (all LAMEbus
device registers are 32-bit) can be read or written atomically in a
single instruction.

<p><b>Ant-32.</b></p>

<p>
The experimental Ant-32 build of System/161 is deprecated.
</p>

<p><b>i386.</b></p>

<p>
LAMEbus for i386 has not been implemented, and probably will not be;
however, if it is, the projected layout is with LAMEBASE at
0xffe0 0000, a boot ROM area below that, and all the rest of the
physical address space potentially used by RAM:
<table width=100%>
<td width=5%>&nbsp;</td><td>

<table width=100% border=1>
<tr><th width=20%>Address</th><th align=left>Region</th></tr>

</table>

</td><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td>
</table>
Note that this is not compatible with the traditional ISA-derived mess
found on stock i386-based machines.
</p>

<p>
Also note that on i386 the virtual memory map can be arranged however
desired.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Bus Configuration</font></h3>

<p>
Because the bus is always mapped, and interrupt lines are always
connected, no explicit configuration of system resources is required.
However, it is still necessary for system software to inspect the bus
to find what devices are connected, and to perform certain control
operations. For that reason, as mentioned above, a 1K config region is
associated with each slot. Each such config region contains the
following registers:

<table width=100%>
<td width=5%>&nbsp;<td>

<table width=100%>
<tr><th width=15% align=left>Name</th>
    <th width=15% align=left>Offset</th>
    <th           align=left>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>VID</td><td><tt>0x00-0x03</tt></td><td>Vendor ID</td></tr>
<tr><td>DID</td><td><tt>0x04-0x07</tt></td><td>Device ID</td></tr>
<tr><td>DRL</td><td><tt>0x08-0x0b</tt></td><td>Device Revision Level</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><tt>0x0c-0x3ff</tt></td><td>Reserved</td></tr>
</table>

</td><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td>
</table>
The Vendor ID, Device ID, and Device Revision Level in combination
uniquely identify the hardware device present in the slot.
<p>

Vendor IDs defined are as follows:
<p>
<table width=100%>
<td width=5%>&nbsp;<td>

<table width=100%>
<tr><th width=15% align=left>Value</th>	<th align=left>Organization</th></tr>
<tr><td><tt>0</tt></td>
    <td>No card present</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>1</tt></td>
    <td>System/161 Development Team</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>0xffff ffff</tt></td>
    <td>Private experimental or research use</td></tr>
<tr><td>Other</td>
    <td>Reserved</td></tr>
</table>

</td><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td>
</table>
If no card is present in a given slot, the other config registers may
contain invalid values, and references to that slot's mapping area
will (normally) cause memory bus errors.
</p>

<p>
The Device ID and Device Revision Level values are defined by the
vendors. The System/161 Development Team devices are documented in an
<A HREF=devices.html>accompanying document</A>.
</p>

<A NAME=controller>
<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Bus Controller</font></h3>

<p>
Offsets 512-1023 (0x200-0x3ff) of the bus controller's own
configuration region are mapped to the bus controller's own
registers.
</p>

<p>
The System/161 2.x multiprocessor bus controller (VID 1, DID 10) has
the following registers:
</p>

<table width=100%>
<td width=5%>&nbsp;<td>

<table width=100%>
<tr><th width=10%>Name</th><th width=10%>Offset</th>
				<th align=left>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>RAMSZ</td><td>0x200-0x203</td>
				<td>Size of physical RAM in bytes</td></tr>
<tr><td>IRQS</td><td>0x204-0x207</td>
			<td>Mask of slots presently interrupting</td></tr>
<tr><td>PWR</td><td>0x208-0x20b</td>
			<td>Power enable register</td></tr>
<tr><td>IRQE</td><td>0x20c-0x20f</td>
			<td>Global interrupt enable register</td></tr>
<tr><td>CPUS</td><td>0x210-0x213</td>
			<td>Mask of CPUs present in the system</td></tr>
<tr><td>CPUE</td><td>0x214-0x217</td>
			<td>Mask of CPUs powered up and executing</td></tr>
<tr><td>SELF</td><td>0x218-0x21b</td>
			<td>Bit corresponding to reading CPU</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>0x21c-0x3ff</td><td>Reserved</td></tr>
</table>

</td><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td>
</table>

<p>
RAMSZ reports the system main board configuration. Writes are
rejected. Where the physical RAM appears in the physical address
space, and whether it is contiguous (and if not, where the gaps are)
depends on the processor type.
</p>

<p>
The IRQS register holds a 1 for each slot that is presently asserting
its IRQ line. Writes to IRQS are rejected; interrupts should be
cleared on the devices generating them. Bit 0 represents slot 0,
etc. Thus bit 31 is the bus controller's bit.
</p>

<p>
The PWR register holds a 1 for each slot that is currently powered.
Writing to this register powers devices on and off. Powering off the
system mainboard switches the system off. Note: if the mainboard is
powered off, all other slots should be powered off as well. At
startup, slots with devices in them are powered; others are
unpowered.
</p>

<p>
The IRQE register holds a 1 for each slot that is allowed to generate
interrupts. Slots whose bit in IRQE is zero may assert their IRQ line
(and thus appear in IRQS) but will not generate a processor interrupt
by doing so.
</p>

<p>
The CPUS register holds a 1 for each CPU that is present on the system
board. These are not necessarily contiguous in the word; in a two-CPU
configuration the CPUs present may be e.g. 0 and 16, leading to a
value of 0x0001 0001 in this register.
</p>

<p>
The CPUE register holds a 1 for each CPU that is enabled, that is,
powered up and executing. Upon board reset only one CPU (the boot CPU)
will be enabled; this will normally be CPU 0. Others that are present
may be activated by writing 1s into this register. Enabling a CPU that
is not present has undefined results.
</p>

<p>
The SELF register holds a 1 in the bit position corresponding to the
currently executing CPU that is reading the register. This allows
distinguishing CPUs from one another. (Note that the system board
cannot distinguish among cores on the same CPU; that requires
additional on-chip facilities.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Device Revision Level.</b>
The device revision level of the multiprocessor system board is 1.
</p>

<A NAME=oldcontroller>
<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Old Bus Controller</font></h3>

<p>
The older System/161 1.x uniprocessor bus controller (VID 1, DID 1),
which is still supported and may be configured as "oldmainboard",
has the following registers:
</p>

<table width=100%>
<td width=5%>&nbsp;<td>

<table width=100%>
<tr><th width=10%>Name</th><th width=10%>Offset</th>
				<th align=left>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>RAMSZ</td><td>0x200-0x203</td>
				<td>Size of physical RAM in bytes</td></tr>
<tr><td>IRQS</td><td>0x204-0x207</td>
			<td>Mask of slots presently interrupting</td></tr>
<tr><td>PWR</td><td>0x208-0x20b</td>
			<td>Power enable register</td></tr>
<tr><td>IRQE</td><td>0x20c-0x20f</td>
			<td>Interrupt enable register</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>0x210-0x3ff</td><td>Reserved</td></tr>
</table>

</td><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td>
</table>

<p>
RAMSZ, IRQS, and IRQE are the same as in the multiprocessor bus
controller.
</p>

<p>
The PWR register switches the system off if the value
<!-- 0xfee1dead -->
0
is written into it. Other writes have no effect, and reading produces
undefined results.
</p>

<p>
<b>Device Revision Levels.</b>
Two levels of the bus controller device are defined.
<ul>
<li> DRL 1, the baseline, supports the RAMSZ, IRQS, and PWR registers.
<li> DRL 2, introduced in System/161 1.15, adds support for the IRQE register.
</ul>
The IRQE register is defined so as to be backwards compatible; that
is, software that works with the DRL 1 device will work with the DRL 2
device without modification.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>CPU Control Area</font></h3>

<p>
Each CPU control area contains the following:
</p>

<table width=100%>
<td width=5%>&nbsp;<td>

<table width=100%>
<tr><th width=10%>Name</th><th width=10%>Offset</th>
			<th align=left>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>CIRQE</td><td>0x000-0x003</td>
			<td>Per-CPU interrupt enable register</td></tr>
<tr><td>CIPI</td><td>0x004-0x007</td>
		<td>Per-CPU inter-processor interrupt register</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>0x008-0x2ff</td><td>Reserved</td></tr>
<tr><td>CRAM</td><td>0x300-0x3ff</td><td>Per-CPU scratch buffer</td></tr>
</table>

</td><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td>
</table>

<p>
CIRQE is the same as IRQE, but per-processor. This allows interrupts
to be routed to one or more processors as desired. CIRQE is applied
downstream of IRQE; that is, an interrupt disabled in IRQE will never
be delivered regardless of the setting of CIRQE on any CPU. Note:
there is no hardware support for dispatching interrupts to multiple
CPUs round-robin fashion.
</p>

<p>
CIPI allows sending inter-processor interrupts. The inter-processor
interrupt pin of each CPU is asserted if its CIPI register contains a
nonzero value.
</p>

<p>
CRAM is a 128-byte scratch area used for system startup, as described
below. After startup it can be used as desired by the OS.
</p>

<p>
On the old uniprocessor motherboard, the entire CPU control area is
reserved and accesses yield undefined behavior.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Supporting Both
Controllers</font></h3>

<p>
A kernel that supports both mainboard types (uniprocessor and
multiprocessor) requires abstraction of the mainboard functions in
software.
Having accomplished that, the uniprocessor mainboard can be made to
mimic a multiprocessor mainboard with one CPU as follows:
<ul>
<li> Reads from CPUS, CPUE, and SELF should yield a falsified value of 1.
<li> Writes to PWR of values other than 0 should be blocked/ignored.
<li> Accesses to CIRQE should be redirected to IRQE.
<li> Writes to CIPI should be blocked/ignored.
<li> Reads from CIPI should yield a falsified value of 0.
<li> Accesses to CRAM should be redirected to a reserved region in
     main memory.
</ul>
Additionally, to be able to run on DRL 1 of the old mainboard such a
kernel must not rely on individual interrupt masking via CIRQE or IRQE
being available at all.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Bus Power-Up</font></h3>

<p>
At power-up time, the devices present are automatically probed and the
VID, DID, and DRL values become available in the configuration
registers. The CPUS register, if present, is loaded. The amount of RAM
present is probed and the RAMSZ register is loaded.
The IRQE and CIRQE registers, if present, are loaded with 0xffff ffff.
All devices are reset to a state such that they will not generate
interrupts until otherwise programmed.
</p>

<p>
At this point, the boot CPU is started. On the multiprocessor board
the CPUE register is loaded so as to enable the boot CPU, usually CPU
0. On the uniprocessor board, the one CPU is simply released from
reset. Control is transferred to the boot ROM.
</p>

<p>
The boot ROM has no published entry points and supplies no services
besides system startup. In fact, it may or may not actually be
present, as in the System/161 environment system startup can be
effected without it, inside the simulator.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Boot ROM</font></h3>

<p>
The boot ROM loads an ELF kernel image in a suitable
processor-dependent way, and jumps to the image's entry point. A
bootup stack is established. A single null-terminated string
(generated from the kernel arguments passed on the System/161 command
line) is passed as a function argument to the entry point.
</p>

<p>
On the multiprocessor system board, the boot string is placed in a
suitable but unspecified location in main memory. The boot stack is
established at the top of the CRAM area.
</p>

<p>
For secondary CPUs and secondary cores on the boot CPU, which are not
normally started until the kernel has taken control of the system, the
boot stack is established at the top of the CRAM area, and the
contents of the lowest word in the CRAM area are read and used as an
entry point to begin execution within the kernel.
</p>

<p>
On the old uniprocessor system board, the boot string and the boot
stack are placed in a suitable but unspecified location in main
memory.
</p>

<p><b>MIPS.</b></p>

<p>
The kernel should be linked to run at or near virtual address
0x8000 0000.
The kernel is loaded into the corresponding physical memory at or near
physical address 0. The boot string (and, if appropriate, the boot
stack) are placed at or near the high end of memory, to avoid
conflicting with the kernel. The kernel should as soon as possible
copy the boot string and establish its own stack in a known
location. Then all memory may be used safely.
</p>

<p>
The address of the boot string is passed in the a0 ($4) register.
The <tt>sp</tt> register points to the top of a stack region as
previously defined. However, the startup code should not assume that a
proper caller stack frame already exists on the stack. (That is,
writing a0 back to its argument slot through the stack pointer may
produce undefined behavior.)
The contents of other registers, including the CPU configuration
registers, are unspecified. The TLB state is unspecified. The CPU
cache is in a state suitable for routine operation.
