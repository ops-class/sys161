Kernel Debugging with <tt>gdb</tt>
</font></h2>

<p>
System/161 supports remote <tt>gdb</tt> debugging directly into the
simulator. The simulator acts like an in-circuit emulator (ICE), only
more so, so that you can debug without any interference whatsoever
with the debugged code. Even timing is unaffected.
</p>

<p>
To do this, you need a copy of <tt>gdb</tt> compiled for the same
processor that System/161 is simulating, and that understands the ELF
kernel file format loaded by System/161. To use the Unix-domain
sockets method shown below, you need a patch to <tt>gdb</tt>; without
that you are restricted to using Internet-domain sockets and you can't
necessarily control who can connect. A suitable <tt>gdb</tt>
configuration is provided for OS/161.
</p>

<p>
Run <tt>gdb</tt> as you normally would:
<pre>
	gdb kernel
</pre>
</p>

<p>
After it finishes loading, attach to System/161 by typing this into
<tt>gdb</tt>:
<pre>
	target remote unix:.sockets/gdb
</pre>
and <tt>gdb</tt> will connect up to the copy of System/161 you have running in
the same directory and you can start debugging. (You can debug one in
another directory by specifying the right path to its socket.)
</p>

<p>
Since this is a painful thing to type every time you want to debug, we
recommend you create a shortcut for it. Put the following in a file
called <tt>.gdbinit</tt> in the same directory you're working in.
(<tt>gdb</tt> runs this file when you start it up.)
<pre>
	define db
	target remote unix:.sockets/gdb
	end
</pre>
Then you can connect up to System/161 for debugging just by running
<tt>gdb</tt> and typing "db".
</p>

<p>
If you give System/161 the <em>-w</em> option, it will stop and wait
for a debugger connection before it runs anything at all. This allows
you to start debugging from the very beginning of kernel
initialization.
</p>

<p>
Theoretically everything you can do with <tt>gdb</tt> normally should
work with <tt>gdb</tt> connected this way. In practice, there are
probably some problems.  Bring them to the attention of the course
staff and we'll see if we can get them fixed.
</p>

<p>
When System/161 is running, if you type ^G (control-G) into its
window, it will immediately stop in <tt>gdb</tt> (if <tt>gdb</tt> is
attached) or wait for a <tt>gdb</tt> connection (if <tt>gdb</tt> is
not attached).
