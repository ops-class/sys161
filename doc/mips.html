System/161 MIPS Processor
</font></h2>

<p>
The 32-bit MIPS is the simplest "real" 32-bit processor for which
development tools are readily available; furthermore, the MIPS
architecture is already widely used for teaching in various contexts.
This makes it a natural choice for System/161.
</p>

<p>
The specific dialect of MIPS processor found in System/161, which for
a lack of a better term we'll refer to as MIPS-161, is partway between
a MIPS-I (r2000/r3000) and a more modern MIPS32. We intentionally use
the simpler MIPS-I MMU architecture; exception handling is MIPS-I
style; but in the interests of sanity cache control, to the extent
it's required at all, is MIPS32. There are also a few idiosyncratic
features specific to the MIPS-161, owing to some things being
unspecified or underspecified in publicly-available documentation.
</p>

<p>
There are two basic versions of the MIPS-161: the System/161 1.x
version and the System/161 2.x version. The 2.x version is
substantially more MIPS32ish and supports multiprocessor environemnts.
Distinguishing these versions on the fly is discussed below.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Cores</font></h3>
<p>
Each MIPS-161 processor has only one core on the die. However, as
noted <A HREF=system.html>elsewhere</A> System/161 supports up to 32
processors on the mainboard. There is little software-visible
difference between 32 single-core processors on one mainboard and 32
cores in one processor.
Most of what effects do exist are cache-related; these are not
currently modeled by System/161 at all.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>User Mode</font></h3>
<p>
In user mode, the MIPS-161 behaves the same as any other 32-bit MIPS.
All user instructions are fully interlocked and there are no pipeline
hazards. All MIPS-I instructions are supported. MIPS-II and higher
instructions are not supported, except (in System/161 2.0 and up) for
the <tt>LL</tt> and <tt>SC</tt> instructions used for multiprocessor
synchronization, and the <tt>SYNC</tt> memory barrier instruction.
Other later MIPS instructions may be added in the future. (However,
the "branch likely" family of instructions will never be supported.)
Please consult your favorite MIPS reference for further details.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Out-of-Order Execution</font></h3>
<p>
The multiprocessor System/161 environment is cache-coherent.
However, even with cache coherence, or when using uncached memory regions,
processors that support out-of-execution may require so-called memory
barrier instructions to ensure that memory accesses occur on the
external bus (and become visible to other processors or devices) in
the same order they are issued in machine code.
</p>

<p>
In the System/161 2.x processor, the MIPS-II <tt>SYNC</tt> instruction
can be used to wait until all pending load and store operations are
complete. This guarantees that all memory updates before the
<tt>SYNC</tt> become visible before any memory updates after the
<tt>SYNC</tt>. All <tt>SYNC</tt> instructions executed on all cores
and processors within a system occur in a single well defined global
order.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Coprocessor Registers</font></h3>
<p>
A MIPS processor can have up to four coprocessors, numbered 0-3.
Coprocessor 0 contains the MMU and other control logic; coprocessor 1
is the FPU (or would be, if System/161 supported an FPU); and
coprocessors 2 and 3 are normally unused.
</p>

<p>
Each coprocessor can have up to 8 banks of 32 registers each.
The "select" number used with some instructions identifies the
register bank.
Most registers of most coprocessors are in "select" 0.
Note that the System/161 1.x processor ignores the "select" field, so
all banks will appear to mirror bank 0.
</p>

<p>
Coprocessor registers are accessed with the <tt>MFC0..3</tt> and
<tt>MTC0..3</tt> family of instructions, to access coprocessors 0
through 3, as follows:
<pre>
	mfc0 $4, $12, 0
</pre>
loads the contents of coprocessor 0 (kernel) register 12 select 0
(STATUS) into general-purpose register 4 (a0), and
<pre>
	mtc0 $4, $12, 0
</pre>
does the reverse.
When the select number is 0 (the common case) it may
be omitted.
</p>

<p>
Coprocessors must be "enabled" before being used by setting a bit in
the STATUS register (see below).
Coprocessor 0 is always enabled when in kernel mode; otherwise,
access to a disabled coprocessor causes a coprocessor unusable
exception (see below).
For the FPU this can be used by system software to support lazy FPU
context switching.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Kernel Mode</font></h3>
<p>
In kernel mode, the MIPS-161 is best thought of as a cache-coherent
MIPS-I with some extensions borrowed from later MIPS dialects,
The following sections are intended to fully define the kernel mode
interface -- anything unspecified here is not an implicit reference to
MIPS-I behavior but a documentation bug.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Kernel Registers</font></h3>

<p>
The MIPS-161 has 11 kernel registers in coprocessor 0. These are:
<ul>
<li> INDEX ($0)
<li> RANDOM ($1)
<li> TLBLO ($2)
<li> CONTEXT ($4)
<li> BADVADDR ($8)
<li> TLBHI ($10)
<li> STATUS ($12)
<li> CAUSE ($13)
<li> EPC ($14)
<li> PRID ($15)
<li> CFEAT ($15 select 1) (System/161 2.x only)
<li> IFEAT ($15 select 2) (System/161 2.x only)
</ul>

with the following bit patterns:

   dholland 20140929: It is not clear to me what the colors in this
   diagram were supposed to mean, and apparently I didn't see fit to
   write them down anywhere. I *think* it goes as follows:
      grey - fixed/uninteresting
      red - read only, set by hardware
      green - read/write, set only by software
      blue - read/write, set by both hardware and software
   This is consistent with the colors in STATUS, both before and after
   my changes today; but if this was the intended model, the ASID
   field of TLBHI should be green. Meh.

INDEX
<ul>
<li> P -- probe failure. Set if the <tt>TLBP</tt> instruction
     fails to find a matching entry in the TLB.
<li> SLOT -- TLB entry index, 0-63. This field is set by the
     <tt>TLBP</tt> instruction; it is also used by the <tt>TLBWI</tt>
     instruction.
</ul>
RANDOM
<ul>
<li> SLOT -- TLB entry index, 0-63, except that the values 0-7 are skipped.
     This field is used by the
     <tt>TLBWR</tt> instruction and is incremented on every clock
     cycle. See below.
</ul>
TLBLO

<li> ASID -- address space ID for this TLB entry.
</ul>
STATUS
<ul>
<li> c0-c3 -- enable bits for coprocessors 0-3. Coprocessor 0 is
     always enabled in kernel mode.

<li> H -- hardware interrupt state, 1=active, lines 0-5.
<li> F -- software interrupt state, 1=active, lines 0-1.

<li> EPC -- saved program counter from exception.
</ul>
PRID
<ul>
<li> PRID -- processor ID code. See discussion below.
</ul>
CFEAT
<ul>
<li> CFEAT -- compatible processor feature bits. None are defined yet,
so this register will read as 0. (In later versions of System/161 it
may not.) Features appearing in this register are backward-compatible;
system software that is not aware of them should be expected to still
operate correctly. The CFEAT register is a MIPS-161 extension; it is
not found in any standard or semistandard MIPS version.
</ul>
IFEAT
<ul>
<li> IFEAT -- incompatible processor feature bits. None are defined
yet, so this register will read as 0. (In later versions of System/161
it may not.) Features appearing in this register are <em>not</em>
backward-compatible. System software that is not aware of them will
probably not work. The IFEAT register is a MIPS-161 extension; it is
not found in any standard or semistandard MIPS version.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The k0 and k1 registers are general-purpose registers (not in
coprocessor 0) that are reserved for use by the kernel during exception
handling.
They are not protected from access in user mode, so system software
must not rely on them remaining unchanged during program execution;
however, the kernel may clobber them freely and will ordinarily do so
on entry to any exception handler.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Kernel Instructions</font></h3>
<p>
The following instructions are available only in kernel mode:
<ul>
<li> MFC0, MTC0 -- access coprocessor 0 (kernel) registers (as above)
<li> WAIT (MIPS-II and up) -- suspend execution until external interrupt
<li> RFE (MIPS-I) -- return from exception
<li> TLBR, TLBWI, TLBWR, TLBP -- control the MMU
</ul>
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans><tt>WAIT</tt></font></h3>
<p>
The <tt>WAIT</tt> instruction has been borrowed from MIPS-II. This
operation puts the processor into a low-power state and suspends
execution until some external event occurs, such as an interrupt.
Since the exact behavior of <tt>WAIT</tt> is not clearly specified
anywhere I could find, the MIPS-161 behavior is as follows:
<ul>
<li> <tt>WAIT</tt> should be executed with interrupts disabled or
     masked in the processor.
<li> <tt>WAIT</tt> will complete when any of the processor interrupt
     pins are activated.
<li> The interrupt is not serviced until it is unmasked or
     re-enabled.
</ul>
WAIT is supported in all MIPS-161 versions.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Trap/Exception Handling</font></h3>

<p>
When an exception occurs, the following things happen:
<nl>
<li> The PC where the exception occurred is loaded into the EPC
register.
<li> If this was in a branch delay slot, the EPC register is set to
the address of the branch (that is, 4 is subtracted) and the BD flag
in the CAUSE register is set. Software need not examine the BD flag
unless the exact address of the faulting instruction is wanted,
e.g. for disassembly and analysis.
<li> The EXC field of the CAUSE register is set to reflect what
happened. The exception codes are listed below.
<li> For coprocessor-related exceptions the CE field of the CAUSE
register is set.
<li> For interrupts the H and F bits of the CAUSE register are set to
reflect the interrupt(s) that are active.
<li> For MMU exceptions the BADVADDR register is loaded with the failing
address. The page portion is placed in the VPAGE field of the TLBHI
register. A masked and shifted form suitable for indexing a page table
is placed in the VSHIFT field of the CONTEXT register.
<li> The bottom six bits of the STATUS register are shifted left by
two. The "o" (old) bits are lost; the "p" (previous) bits become the
old bits; the "c" (current) bits become the previous bits; and the
current bits are set to 0. This disables interrupts and puts the
processor in kernel mode.
<li> Execution continues from one of five hardwired addresses
according to what happened and the setting of the B (boot) bit in the
STATUS register.
</p>

<p>
The exception handler addresses are:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td><td>
<table width=100%>
<tr><th align=left>B</th><th align=left>Trap</th>
                         <th align=left>Address</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td> <td>General</td> <td>0xbfc0 0180</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td> <td>UTLB</td>    <td>0xbfc0 0100</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td> <td>Reset</td>   <td>0xbfc0 0000</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td> <td>General</td> <td>0x8000 0080</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td> <td>UTLB</td>    <td>0x8000 0000</td></tr>
</table>
</td><td width=5%></tr>
</table>
A UTLB exception is a TLB miss that occurs against the user address
space (0x0000 0000 - 0x7fff ffff) and occurs because no matching TLB
entry was found. Other TLB exceptions go through the General vector.
This allows a fast-path TLB refill handler. See below.
</p>

<p>
Handling an exception generally requires saving state somewhere; the
k0 and k1 registers (as noted above) can be clobbered arbitrarily by
exception handlers and can be used while finding the context needed to
save state safely.
</p>

<p>
To return from an exception, one executes the following sequence:
<pre>
	jr k0
	rfe
</pre>
where the k0 register has been loaded with the desired exception
return address, either the value previously retrieved from the EPC
register or some other address chosen by software. The RFE instruction
is not a jump; it occurs in the delay slot of a jump. It shifts the
six bottom bits of the status register right by two, undoing the shift
done at exception entry time. This returns the processor to whatever
interrupt state and mode (user/kernel) it was in when the exception
occurred.
</p>

<p>
Because there are three pairs of state bits, the processor can take
two nested exceptions without losing state, if one is careful. This is
to facilitate the fast-path TLB refill handler. See below.
</p>

<p>
The two soft interrupt lines can be activated by writing to the CAUSE
register.
</p>

<p>
The exception codes:
<ul>
<li> IRQ (0) -- Interrupt
<li> MOD (1) -- "Modify", TLB read-only fault
<li> TLBL (2) -- TLB miss on load
<li> TLBS (3) -- TLB miss on store
<li> ADEL (4) -- Address error on load
<li> ADES (5) -- Address error on store
<li> IBE (6) -- Bus error on instruction fetch
<li> DBE (7) -- Bus error on data access
<li> SYS (8) -- System call
<li> BP (9) -- Breakpoint instruction
<li> RI (10) -- Reserved (illegal) instruction
<li> CPU (11) -- Coprocessor unusable
<li> OVF (12) -- Integer overflow
<li> 13-15 -- Reserved
</ul>
The IBE and DBE exceptions are not MMU exceptions and do not set
BADVADDR.
They mean that something went wrong on the external memory bus (e.g.
access to nonexistent physical memory) which usually means a kernel
bug.
Division by zero manifests as a breakpoint instruction.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>MMU</font></h3>
<p>
The MMU is the MIPS-I MMU, with a 64-entry fully associative TLB where
each entry maps one 4K virtual page to one 4K physical page. The
paired pages setup of later MIPS processors is not present, and there
is no support for superpages.
</p>

<p>
The processor's virtual address space is divided into four segments:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td><td>
<table width=100%>
<tr><th width=15% align=left>Name</th><th align=left>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>kseg2</td><td>Kernel mode only; TLB-mapped, cacheable</td></tr>
<tr><td>kseg1</td><td>Kernel mode only; direct-mapped, uncached</td></tr>
<tr><td>kseg0</td><td>Kernel mode only; direct-mapped, cached</td></tr>
<tr><td>kuseg</td><td>User and kernel mode; TLB-mapped, cacheable</td></tr>
</table>
</td><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>
The mapped segments are mapped via a translation lookaside buffer
(TLB) with software refill. The direct-mapped segments are mapped
(without use of the TLB) both to the first 512 megabytes of the 
physical memory space.
Typically the kernel lives in kseg0, hardware devices are accessed
through kseg1, any pageable kernel data lives in kseg2, and user-mode
programs are run in kuseg.
</p>

<p>
There are four MMU-related instructions:
<ul>
<li> <tt>TLBR</tt> uses the SLOT field of the INDEX register to choose
a TLB entry, and reads it into the TLBLO and TLBHI registers.
<li> <tt>TLBWI</tt> uses the SLOT field of the INDEX register to choose
a TLB entry, and writes the TLBLO and TLBHI registers into it.
<li> <tt>TLBWR</tt> uses the SLOT field of the RANDOM register to choose
a TLB entry, and writes the TLBLO and TLBHI registers into it.
<li> <tt>TLBP</tt> searches the TLB for an entry matching the TLBHI
register, and sets the SLOT field of the INDEX register to its number,
unless no entry was found, in which case the P field of the INDEX
register is set to -1. (This makes the value of the INDEX register
negative, which is easily tested.)
</ul>
The INDEX field of the RANDOM register ranges from 8 to 63; it is
incremented on every instruction executed, which is not very random
but apparently adequate for the purpose, which is to fill the TLB
rapidly and effectively. Entries 0 through 7 of the TLB are never
touched by <tt>TLBWR</tt> and can be used for reserved or special
mappings.
</p>

<p>
The processor is built to support a fast-path TLB refill handler,
which is invoked via the UTLB exception vector (see above). The idea
is that the OS maintains page tables in virtual memory using the kseg2
region (see above) and loads the base address of the page table into
the PTBASE field of the CONTEXT register. Each page table entry (PTE) is a
4-byte quantity suitable for loading directly into the TLBLO register;
1024 of these fit on a 4K page, so each page table page maps 4MB and
it takes 512 pages, or 2MB of virtual space, to map the whole 2GB user
address space. (Since these are placed in virtual memory, only the
page table pages that are used need be materialized.) With this setup,
the UTLB exception handler can then read the CONTEXT register and use
the resulting value to load directly from the page table. If this
fails because that section of the page table is not materialized, a
second (non-UTLB) exception occurs. Careful register usage and the
three-deep nesting of the bottom part of the STATUS register allows
the general-purpose exception handler to recover from this condition
and proceed as desired. On success, the UTLB handler can then
unconditionally store the PTE it got into the TLBLO register and write
it into the TLB with the TLBWR instruction. If the V (valid)
bit is not set, on return from the UTLB handler another exception will
occur; however, because a matching (though not valid) TLB entry
exists, this will not be a UTLB exception, and the general exception
handler will get control and can schedule pagein or whatever.
</p>

<p>
There are a number of possible other ways to use the UTLB handler, of
course. One simple way is to just have it jump to the general-purpose
exception handler.
</p>

<p>
As noted above, the V (valid) bit does not prevent a TLB entry from
being "matching". A TLB entry is matching if both of the following are
true:
<ul>
<li> The VPAGE of the entry matches the virtual address being
     translated, and
<li> either the ASID of the entry matches the ASID currently loaded
     into the TLBHI register, or the entry has the G (global) flag
     set.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
One must never load the TLB in such a fashion that two (or more)
entries can match the same virtual address. If this happens, the
processor shuts down and is unrecoverable except by hard reset.
Since there is no way to prevent entries from matching, one should
clear the TLB by loading each entry with a distinct VPAGE, and use
VPAGEs from the kseg0 or kseg1 regions that will never be presented to
the MMU for translation. To reset the TLB at startup, since it is not
cleared by processor reset, one should use a second, potentially
larger, set of distinct VPAGEs and check that each is not already
present before loading it.
</p>

<p>
There is no way to tell if a TLB entry has been used, or how recently
it has been used. Nor is there a direct way to tell if a TLB entry has
been used for writing. The D ("dirty") bit can be used for this
purpose with software support, as follows:
<ul>
<li> When the TLB entry is first loaded, clear the D bit. This will
     make the MMU treat the translation as read-only.
<li> Upon a write, a MOD exception will occur. If writing through this
     translation is legal, set the D bit in the TLB and anywhere else
     in the virtual memory system data structures that might be
     desired. The page is now dirty, and the processor will write to
     it freely.
<li> When the page is written back or otherwise cleaned, or on a
     periodic basis to measure usage over time, flush the TLB entry or
     reload it with the D bit clear again.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The processor never changes the address space ID found in the ASID
field of the TLBHI register.
System software can switch among up to 64 address spaces by altering
this value.
(If more are needed, address space IDs can be reused by flushing TLB
entries.)
At the cost of performance, system software can also leave the ASID
field set to a constant value and change address spaces by flushing
the whole TLB.
</p>

<p>
The MMU exceptions are as follows:
<ul>
<li> MOD -- attempt to write through a TLB entry whose D bit is not
     set. Software should respond either by making the TLB entry
     writable or treating the condition as a failure.
<li> TLBL -- TLB miss (entry not present, or entry not valid) on a
     data read. If the address was in kuseg and the entry was not
     present, the UTLB handler is invoked. Otherwise the general
     exception handler is invoked. The failing address is placed in
     BADVADDR, and as noted above in the VSHIFT field of the CONTEXT
     register. The VPAGE field of the TLBHI register is also loaded.
     Software should respond by loading a matching and valid
     translation, or treating the condition as a failure.
<li> TLBS -- TLB miss on store. Otherwise the same as TLBL.
<li> ADEL -- address error on load. An address error is either an
     unaligned access or an attempt to access kernel memory while in
     user mode. Software should respond by treating the condition as a
     failure.
<li> ADES -- same as ADEL, but for stores.
</ul>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Cache Control</font></h3>

<p>
The MIPS-I has a remarkably painful cache and cache control
architecture.
This is not supported.
Attempting to set either the "swap caches" or "isolate cache" bits in
the STATUS register, as one does with a MIPS-I, will trigger a machine
check.
</p>

<p>
Currently, the MIPS-161 is fully cache-coherent (in fact, System/161
does not model the cache at all) and there is no need to flush,
examine, or otherwise touch the cache subsystem.
However, future releases may include more cache handling; caches are
an important part of performance modeling and storing predecoded
instructions in an instruction cache will likely make things run faster.
</p>

<p>
Since real MIPS processors have split instruction and data caches,
flushing the instruction cache is required in certain contexts.
As of this writing a MIPS32-compatible CONFIG1 register reporting the
L1 cache configuration, and the matching CACHE instruction to
flush and otherwise manipulate the caches, are implemented, but
adequate documentation has not yet been written.
</p>

<p>
It is recommended that code written for System/161 include stubbed-out
calls for flushing the instruction cache in the places needed; this
will allow such code to run with caching enabled on future versions
with minimal modification.
It is similarly recommended that such code also include stubbed-out
calls for flushing or invalidating the data cache if there are any
places where this is necessary.
</p>

<p>
It is safe to assume that any future cache will be PIPT (physically
indexed, physically tagged) -- because System/161 is an instructional
tool, it attempts to avoid unnecessary student-facing complexity, and
therefore VIPT (virtually indexed, physically tagged) or worse VIVT
(virtually indexed, virtually tagged) caches are contraindicated.
(Because it is an instructional tool, it might sometime include an
optional VIPT or VIVT cache specifically for use teaching about the
horrors; but if so this will be a configurable option, not the default
mode.)
</p>

<p>
Any future cache will also be coherent between processors;
multiprocessor architectures with non-coherent caches are horrible to
try to program.
<!-- but what about data writes on other processors and the icache? -->
</p>

<p>
In this setup, the instruction cache need only be flushed when
something modifies physical memory containing instructions.
Assuming no self-modifying code, this normally arises only in the
virtual memory system when swapping in and out pages that contain
code, or (where separate) when first loading executable code into
memory.
</p>

<p>
The data cache only needs to be flushed if hardware devices other than
the CPU are accessing memory.
In general, the cache must be flushed (in the sense of written back)
before hardware reads memory the processor has written, and it must be
flushed (in the sense of invalidated, to force a fresh read) before
the processor reads memory the hardware has written.
Since the hardware devices in System/161 do not support DMA (direct
memory access) this will not normally arise.
However, accessing the I/O buffers on LAMEbus devices with the cache
enabled (through kseg0 instead of kseg1) will require flushing the
data cache as just described.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Startup</font></h3>

<p>
On CPU reset execution begins from the Reset vector defined above.
The processor starts out in an almost completely undefined state.
The cache is in an undefined state (except on the MIPS-161 this does
not matter...), the TLB is in an undefined state, and the contents of
the general and kernel-mode registers are all undefined, except as
follows:
<ul>
<li> The B (boot) flag of the STATUS register is set to 1, so
     exceptions will go to the boot exception vectors in kseg1 instead
     of the kernel exception vectors in kseg0.
<li> The KUc and IEc bits of the STATUS register are set to 0, so the
     processor is in kernel mode and interrupts are disabled.
</ul>
The code at the Reset vector must in general sort out the processor
state before it can do anything else.
</p>

<p>
In System/161, the boot ROM takes care of these issues and loads a
kernel as described in the <A HREF=lamebus.html>LAMEbus
documentation</A>. However, the state guaranteed by the boot ROM is
only slightly more flexible: the boot ROM guarantees that the cache is
in a workable state, and it provides a stack and an argument string in
the a0 register. The TLB is still in an undefined state and the
contents of other general and kernel-mode registers and register
fields are still undefined.
</p>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Identifying the
Processor</font></h3>

<p>
Distinguishing the MIPS-161 from an arbitrarily chosen MIPS-I is
likely to be problematic: according to the lore, the PRID register
values for MIPS-I processors could not reliably be used to distinguish
processor types even in real deployed hardware. The recommended method
is to arrange to know that you have a MIPS-161 because you are running
on System/161; then the scheme below can be used to identify which
version you have. If this is not feasible, you're on your own. It
might be possible to detect the MIPS-161 by enabling certain cache
control bits and ascertaining that they have no effect.
</p>

<p>
The System/161 1.x processor can be distinguished from the System/161
2.x processor by fetching the value from the PRID register. The top
half of the PRID register is 0 (because the MIPS-161 is not a MIPS32
or MIPS64, doesn't have an official vendor ID, and isn't likely to get
one) and the bottom half gives the version:
<ul>
<li> 0x3ff (1023) identifies System/161 1.x
<li> 0xa1 (161) identifies System/161 2.x
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The processors in pre-2.0 versions of System/161 prior to 1.99.07 also
report 0x3ff in the PRID register.
These can be detected by checking the LAMEbus mainboard version; if
the multiprocessor mainboard is present, the processor supports LL/SC
and the on-chip timer
<!-- XXX --> (not documented herein yet, alas)
but are lacking SYNC, coprocessor register selects, the
CFEAT/IFEAT registers, and any other features described above as
2.x-only.
Other than this, no guarantees are made about
mainboard versions and features vs. CPU versions and features.
Mainboard and CPU properties can be selected independently in
<tt>sys161.conf</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Some ancient prerelease versions of System/161 (0.95 and earlier)
reported 0xbeef in the PRID register. These versions are now long gone
and can be ignored. The documentation also for a long time described
the PRID value for the System/161 1.x processor as 0xbeef; this was
incorrect.
</p>

<p>
CPU features beyond those found by default in the System/161 2.x
processor should be probed by checking the CFEAT and IFEAT registers,
after confirming that a System/161 2.x processor is in fact present.
See the descriptions of these feature bits above. (So far, there are
none.)
