<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Introduction & Contents</font></h3>

<p>
System/161 is a synthetic (read: made up) hardware platform designed
specifically for teaching operating systems and for experimental
operating system hacking. It includes a simulated CPU, system bus, and
bus devices that are realistic but simple and easy to work with.
</p>

<p>
New in System/161 2.x: support for multiprocessor and multicore
system configurations.

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Running System/161</font></h3>

<p>
There are two versions of System/161 that are built and installed: the
normal one, <tt>sys161</tt>, and one compiled to be able to log
information about what's happening and generally assist debugging,
which is called <tt>trace161</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The general format for the command line for either of these is like
this:
<blockquote>
	<tt>sys161</tt> [ <em>System/161 options</em> ] 
		<em>kernel</em> [ <em>kernel options</em> ]
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
The <em>System/161 options</em> are:
<blockquote>
<dl>

<dt>-c <em>configfile</em></dt>
<dd>Specify alternate config file. Default is <tt>sys161.conf</tt>.</dd>

<dt>-C <em>slot:arg</em></dt>
<dd>Supply additional config argument to the device in the given slot.
Applied after the config file is loaded, so values passed on the
command line override values in the config file. Note that for now at
least you cannot change the device mappings on the command line, only
adjust arguments. The most common use of this option is probably to
adjust the system memory size and/or CPU count.</dd>

<dt>-D <em>count</em></dt>
<dd>Enable the doom counter. After the specified number of disk
writes, the machine halts abruptly. (This is useful for testing file
systems.) Individual disks can be marked "nodoom" in the config file,
in which case writes to those disks do not count. (This is useful for
your swap disk.)</dd>

<dt>-p <em>port</em></dt>
<dd>Listen for debugger connections on specified TCP port. The default
is to use the Unix-domain socket <tt>./.sockets/gdb</tt> for debugger
connections.
<br><font size=-1><strong>Note: because the remote gdb protocol
does not support authentication, use this option only with
caution.</strong></font></dd>

<dt>-s</dt>
<dd>Pass signal-generating characters (^C, ^Z, etc.) through to the
running kernel instead of treating them as requests to sys161.</dd>

<dt>-w</dt>
<dd>Wait for a debugger connection immediately on startup.</dd>

<dt>-X</dt>
<dd>Do not hang waiting for the debugger; exit instead.</dd>

<dt>-Z secs</dt>
<dd>Check for progress and first warn, then drop to the debugger if no
progress occurs in the specified amount of simulator time. Progress is
defined as successfully retiring an instruction in user mode. Don't
use this option with in-kernel test workloads.</dd>

</dl>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
The following additional options control trace161's tracing and are
ignored by sys161:
<blockquote>
<dl>

<dt>-f <em>tracefile</em></dt>
<dd>Set the file trace information is logged to. By default, stderr is
used. Specifying -f- sends output to stdout instead of stderr.</dd>

<dt>-t <em>traceflags</em></dt>
<dd>Tell System/161 what to trace. The following flags are available:
   <table>
   <tr><td>d</td>	<td>Trace disk I/O</td></tr>
   <tr><td>e</td>	<td>Trace emufs I/O</td></tr>
   <tr><td>j</td>	<td>Trace jumps and branches</td></tr>
   <tr><td>k</td>	<td>Trace instructions in kernel mode</td></tr>
   <tr><td>n</td>	<td>Trace network I/O</td></tr>
   <tr><td>t</td>	<td>Trace TLB/MMU activity</td></tr>
   <tr><td>u</td>	<td>Trace instructions in user mode</td></tr>
   <tr><td>x</td>	<td>Trace exceptions</td></tr>
   </table>
   Caution: tracing instructions generates huge amounts of output
   that may overwhelm smaller host systems.
</dd>

</dl>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
The following option is also only available in trace161:
<blockquote>
<dl>

<dt>-P</dt>
<dd>Collect a kernel profile and leave it in the file
<tt>gmon.out</tt> for analysis by <tt>gprof</tt>.</dd>

</dl>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
The <em>kernel</em> is an operating system kernel to load and run. It
should be an ELF-format executable for the same processor type as
System/161 is compiled to support. For further information, see below.
</p>

<p>
Note that options found after the kernel name will be passed to the
kernel and not interpreted by System/161.
</p>

<p>
As of version 2.0.5 the exit codes produced by System/161 are
specified as follows:
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>0</dt>
<dd>Ordinary shutdown.</dd>
<dt>1</dt>
<dd>Crash shutdown caused by software failure.</dd>
<dt>2</dt>
<dd>Configuration, user, or runtime errors.</dd>
<dt>3</dt>
<dd>Explicit request: doom counter or debugger kill.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
Note that in general software failures cannot reliably be
distinguished from ordinary shutdowns.
The crash shutdown exit code will be generated in the following cases:
<ul>
<li>Exits taken when the -X option is in use, e.g. from illegal
hardware operations or from a -Z timeout.
(When -X is not in effect, these events stop and wait for a debugger
connection.)</li>
<li>System power-off, if at least one explicit debugger request was
made via the trace device.
With recent versions of OS/161 this normally means a kernel panic
occurred; but note that nothing guarantees a panic will necessarily
trigger such a request.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<A NAME=disks>

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Manipulating disk images</font></h3>

<p>
The <tt>disk161</tt> tool can be used to manipulate disk images.
It supports three actions: <tt>create</tt>, to create a new disk
image; <tt>info</tt>, to print image information; and <tt>resize</tt>,
to change the size of an image.
</p>

<p>
<b>Create.</b> Create a disk image like this:
<pre>
   disk161 create LHD0.img 5M
</pre>
This creates an image called <tt>LHD0.img</tt> capable of holding 5
megabytes of data.
The size is given in bytes, but as above can given one of the suffixes
<tt>G</tt>, <tt>M</tt>, <tt>K</tt>, or <tt>s</tt> for gigabytes,
megabytes, kilobytes, sectors (512-byte units) respectively.
The size must be a unit number of sectors.
</p>

<p>
<b>Info.</b> After creating <tt>LHD0.img</tt> as above,
<pre>
   disk161 info LHD0.img
</pre>
prints
<pre>
   LHD0.img size 5242880 bytes (10240 sectors; 5120K; 5M)
   LHD0.img spaceused 8192 bytes (16 sectors; 8K; 0M)
</pre>
meaning that the image holds up to 5M, but is currently only using 8K.
(This is because the image is a sparse file by default; it only uses
space for regions that have had data written to them.
The only thing in a new image is the image header block, which is one
sector rather than 8K; but here 8K is the host file system's block
size.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Resize.</b> Change the size of a disk image like this:
<pre>
   disk161 resize LHD0.img 10M
</pre>
which makes the image twice as big as before.
You can also use + or - on the size argument to expand or shrink the
image by a specified amount.
Note that resizing the image will not resize any file system or other
logical structure that may be stored on it.
That must be done separately with other tools.
Shrinking an image without doing this will destroy data.
