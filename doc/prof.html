Kernel Profiling
</font></h2>

<p>
System/161 has the ability to collect kernel execution profiles for
offline analysis, e.g. with <tt>gprof</tt>.
This is transparent (does not require compiling the kernel with -pg)
and independent of the kernel's own execution.
</p>

<h3>Basic usage</h3>
<p>
Profiling support is one of the "slow" features available only when
running <tt>trace161</tt>.
The <em>-P</em> command-line option enables profile collection; when
System/161 shuts down the profile data is written to the file
<tt>gmon.out</tt>.
To collect and analyze a basic profile:
<pre>
	trace161 -P kernel
	gprof kernel | less
</pre>
This much is sufficient for many purposes.
</p>

<h3>Profiling control</h3>
<p>
The <A HREF=devices.html#trace>trace control device</A> contains two
registers that can be used to manipulate the profiler.
If your kernel has a driver for this device, it can turn profile
collection on and off dynamically and, when desired, clear the
accumulating profile data.
This can be used to e.g. exclude bootup activities from a profile, to
profile single workloads, or for certain more advanced techniques.
</p>

<p>
If you have a contended lock, you can get a profile of what happens
while that lock is held by enabling profile collection when the lock
is acquired and disabling it again when the lock is released.
The resulting profile will contain sampling data and call graph data
only for code reached while the lock is held; this can often pinpoint
problems that are invisible in a full profile.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, if you find your interrupt response latencies are too high,
you can profile what happens with interrupts disabled by turning
profile collection on and off in the code that manipulates the
interrupt state.
</p>

<p>
Finally, you can profile the execution of background threads (syncers,
pagers, reapers, etc.) by having the thread switch code enable
profiling when the target thread is running.
</p>

<h3>Numerical considerations</h3>
<p>
The statistical profiler samples at 1000 Hz.
(This frequency can be cranked up further if necessary by changing
PROFILE_NSECS in speed.h and recompiling System/161.)
The sampling bins are 16 bytes wide; on MIPS this is only four
instructions.
As a result of these considerations the profiling results are
considerably more precise than gprof believes by default; it is
usually reasonable to increase the number of figures in the gprof
output.
Unfortunately, only some versions of gprof seem to support this.
</p>

<h3>Important restriction</h3>
<p>
Currently the sampling profiler samples only from CPU 0.
Code running on other CPUs is not sampled.
This bug does not apply to the call graph and call counting
data; even so, for best results configure only one CPU when profiling.
