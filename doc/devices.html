An interrupt is generated when the countdown time reaches 0. The
countdown timer is automatically restarted if the restart-on-expiry
register has a nonzero value.
<p>

Reading from the speaker produces undefined behavior.
<p>

The current time registers represent UTC, where the epoch is midnight
on January 1, 1970, as per the Unix <tt>time</tt> call. (In 2038 this will
break. Oh no.)

A 512-byte sector transfer buffer is mapped at offset 32768.
<p>

The disk can do one operation at a time. To perform an operation,
store the sector number into the sector register, and then write
either the read-in-progress or write-in-progress values into the 
status register. Changing the sector number register while an
operation is in progress produces undefined results.
<p>

The status register reports the present state of the disk. When it
is reporting a completed operation, the IRQ line is raised. Writing
zero back (or starting another operation) clears the interrupt
condition. Writing zero back when an operation is in progress aborts
the operation. Writing values other than zero or the values that 
start operations into the status register produces undefined
results. 
<p>

The disk is assumed to never need low-level formatting. The sector
size is 512 bytes. Note that the 32-bit linear sector addressing
limits disk size to 2^32 * 512 = 2^41 bytes, or 2 TB. In practice
implementations may have lower limits.
<p>

The status register bits are as follows:
<blockquote>
<table width=100% border=0>
<tr><th width=10%>Code</th><th align=left>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td>	<td>Operation in progress</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td>	<td>Operation is write</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td>	<td>Operation completed</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td>	<td>Invalid sector number</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td>	<td>Media error</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

This results in the following values being meaningful in the status
register:
<blockquote>
<table width=100% border=0>
<tr><th width=10%>Code</th><th align=left>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td>	<td>Device idle</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td>	<td>Read operation in progress</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td>	<td>Write operation in progress</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td>	<td>Read operation succeeded</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td>	<td>Write operation succeeded</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td>	<td>Invalid sector number on read</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td>	<td>Invalid sector number on write</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td>	<td>Media error on read</td></tr>
<tr><td>22</td>	<td>Media error on write</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

Once a write operation has reported successful completion, the disk
guarantees that the complete sector written will in fact make it to
stable storage.

This is a very, very simple console interface. Writing to the first
register causes a character to be printed. Reading from it returns the
last character typed. 
<p>

You must wait until one write has completed before starting another
one, or the output may be garbled.
<p>

The two IRQ registers have three bits each. Bit 0 (IRQEN) controls
whether interrupts are generated; if bit 0 is clear, interrupts for
writes or reads (respectively) will not be generated at all.
<p>

Bit 1 (CMPL) is latched on when the device completes a (write or read,
respectively) operation. It can be cleared by software. Bit 2 (FORCE)
is controlled only by software. The device's IRQ line is asserted if
either the write or read IRQ register is in an asserting state; an IRQ
register is in an asserting state if bit 0 is set and either bit 1 or
bit 2 is set.
<p>

The FORCE bit can be used to perform polled I/O without causing the
IRQ line to flap, which can cause problems in multiprocessor
configurations. The basic approach is to set FORCE during the polled
I/O if an IRQ was already pending, to keep it pending until the polled
I/O is complete, and to clear IRQEN during the polled I/O if an IRQ
was not already pending, to avoid triggering a spurious interrupt.
See the OS/161 2.x driver (1.99.06 or higher) for example code.
<p>

NOTE: Bit 2 is only supported in System/161 versions 1.99.05 and up.
The device revision is 1 regardless; if necessary the feature can be
probed by writing FORCE (without IRQEN) to one of the IRQ registers
and then reading the register back. If FORCE is read back, the feature
is present; if 0 is read back, the feature is not available. Note that
drivers written for prior versions of System/161 without the FORCE bit
will continue to work as before.
<p>

The characters read from the device are 8-bit ASCII and control
characters in the range 0-255. Non-ASCII keys, such as cursor keys or
function keys, may appear as strings beginning with an escape
sequence, or as values greater than 255. Unfortunately, in practice
such characters may come from any of a number of sources and it is not
practical to attempt to document their values or even map them into a
single consistent set.

Memory mapped screen interface. 32k of screen memory is mapped at
offset 32768. The cursor position and display size registers are
encoded with the X value in the most significant 16 bits and the Y
value in the least significant 16 bits, with a zero base.
<p>

To make the cursor invisible, move it off the screen. This may or may
not work depending on the display.
<p>

Reading is the same as with the serial console device. Writing is
accomplished by scribbling in screen memory, one byte per character,
increasing addresses moving first to the right then down across the
screen.
<p>

Writing to the display size register should, in principle, work, but
in practice will not.

A 4k read buffer followed by a 4k write buffer is mapped at offset
32768. Packets may not exceed 4k.
<p>

Simple network interface.
<p>

Bit 0 of each interrupt register is set when a receive (or transmit)
is complete. These bits may be cleared by writing 0 back. If either
interrupt register is nonzero, the card's IRQ line is asserted.
<p>

The control register contains two bits: bit 0 controls promiscuous
mode, and bit 1 controls packet sending. If the promiscuous mode bit
is set, all packets seen will be received, even those whose
destination is elsewhere. Setting bit 1 starts a packet transmit. 
Do not set bit 1 while a transmit is already in progress; undefined
behavior may result. The rest of the control register is reserved and
should be set to 0.
<p>

The lower 16 bits of the status register report the device hardware
address. The rest is reserved. The status register is read-only.
<p>

To transmit, a packet should first be assembled in the send buffer.
The destination and length fields in the link-level header must be set
correctly. (The source and frame fields will be set by the card during
transmit. However, the entire link-level header should be placed in
the send buffer.) Then bit 1 of the control register should be set to
1 to start transmission. An interrupt will occur when transmission is
complete.
<p>

To receive, merely copy each packet out of the receive buffer as
receive interrupts occur. Further packets arriving are discarded while
the receive interrupt register is nonzero, so packets may be copied
without being corrupted by further input.
<p>

The link-level packet header is 8 bytes long and has the following
fields (always in network byte order):

<blockquote>
<table width=95% border=0>
<tr><th align=left>Offset</th><th align=left>Size</th>
<th align=left>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td>	<td>2</td>	<td>Framing word (0xa4b3)</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td>	<td>2</td>	<td>Hardware from-address</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td>	<td>2</td>	<td>Total packet length</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td>	<td>2</td>	<td>Hardware to-address</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

The length field should hold the entire packet length, including the
space taken by the header.
<p>

The hardware address 0xffff is the broadcast address; the hardware
address 0x0000 is reserved for sending keepalives to the network hub.
Software should not send packets to hardware address 0x0000.

This device controls <tt>trace161</tt>'s trace flags, allowing them to
be set or cleared on the fly. To set a trace flag, write the letter of
its trace option to the trace-on register; to clear it, use the
trace-off register. The letters are the same as those used on the
<tt>trace161</tt> command line. If running <tt>sys161</tt> rather than
<tt>trace161</tt>, this device may exist and be used, but the trace
registers have no effect.
<p>

The debugging printout register, if written to, causes <tt>trace161</tt>
or <tt>sys161</tt> to print a debug message, which includes the value
written to the register.
<p>

The system state dump register, if written to, will cause a complete
dump of the simulation state, tagged with the value written to the
register. This feature is primarily intended for testing and debugging
System/161 itself.
<p>

The software debugger request register, if written to, will cause
System/161 to drop to the debugger.
This is preferable to explicitly inserting a breakpoint instruction,
because debuggers don't cope very well with hitting breakpoint
instructions they didn't insert themselves.
<p>

When System/161 is collecting a profile, the profiling enable toggle
register can be used to turn profile sampling on and off. Writing zero
disables sampling; writing nonzero enables sampling. This value may be
read back. Sampling is on by default if profiling was requested on the
<tt>trace161</tt> command line; otherwise this register always reads
zero and ignores writes.
<p>

If a profile is being collected, writing to the profiling data clear
register erases all currently stored profile information. This can be
used, for example, to discard profile data from system boot.
<p>

The software debugger request register was introduced in DRL 2.
(This appeared in the System/161 2.0 release, after 1.99.10.)
A device that reports DRL 1 does not have this register and attempts
to write to it will fault.
<p>

The profiling enable toggle and profiling data clear registers were
introduced in DRL 3. (This appeared in System/161 2.0.3.) A device
that reports DRL 1 or 2 does not have these registers and accesses to
them will fault.
<p>

All these registers, except for the profiling enable toggle register,
are write-only.

Reading the register returns a 32-bit random value. In the simulated
version, this value is generated by a pseudo-random generator whose
seed can be specified explicitly. This allows for repeatable results,
which can be helpful in some contexts.
