System/161 Virtual Hardware
</font></h2>

<p>
System/161 is a machine simulator. The virtual machine it simulates is
a server-class computer, with a serial console, multiple CPUS,
multiple disks, and one or more network interfaces. The formal
processor clock speed is 25 MHz, the speed of a high-end server circa
about 1990. This speed is a tradeoff between genuine processor speeds
and the speed the simulator code can manage in real time, which is
markedly lower.
</p>

<p>
The virtual machine is constructed in as simple a fashion as is
reasonably possible while still maintaining most of the feel of real
hardware. (The part of dealing with real hardware you miss out on is
the part where the interfaces are screwy and the devices don't work
half the time.)
</p>

<p>
The machine has 32 slots in a passive backplane bus called LAMEbus.
One slot contains the system board with the LAMEbus bus controller.
This board may contain up to 32 CPUs, each of which may potentially
contain multiple cores.
Each additional slot may be configured with any of several hardware
devices. This configuration is established using a config file, named
by default <tt>sys161.conf</tt>. Future versions of System/161 may
provide a user interface for device configuration and/or allow devices
to be inserted and removed on the fly ("hotplugged"), but this is not
currently supported.
</p>

<p>
<A HREF=lamebus.html>Programming information for LAMEbus</A>
</p>

<p>
The system board contains up to 32 simulated 32-bit MIPS
microprocessors.
The MIPS is the simplest "real" 32-bit processor for which development
tools are readily available; furthermore, the MIPS architecture is
already widely used for teaching in various contexts. This makes it a
natural choice.

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Config File Syntax</font></h3>

<p>
By default the config file is named <tt>sys161.conf</tt> and read from
the current directory. An alternate file can be used by specifying the
<em>-c</em> option. The syntax is line-oriented, with <tt>#</tt>
comments. Each line specifies the contents of a slot, which may be
between 0 and 31, and includes optional configuration arguments for
the device to be inserted. The format of a configuration line is as
follows:
<blockquote>
<em>slot-number</em> <em>device-name</em> [<em>args</em>...]
</blockquote>
The system board (bus controller) must always be placed in slot 31.

<h3><font face=tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans>Timing</font></h3>
<p>
System/161 maintains timings internally at a granularity of a single
clock cycle; thus it can be used for very accurate profiling, to the
extent that its execution time model is realistic.
</p>

<p>
The timings in System/161 have the following known limitations:
<ul>
<li> System/161 does not implement a cache simulator. All accesses are
     assumed to be satisfiable in one cycle from main memory. This is
     not completely crazy for a 25MHz cycle time; however, as cache
     effects are very important for performance today, it is
     displeasing. Future releases of System/161 may include more cache
     modeling.
<li> All instructions execute in one cycle. This is the intent of the
     MIPS architecture for most ordinary integer instructions;
     however, it should not be true for e.g. multiplies and divides.
<li> The disk timing model is weird and broken. Sometime it should be
     replaced with either a real one or at least a better one.
<li> The serial console was originally supposed to be 9600 bps; then
     it got cranked up to 19200 bps, and then a substantial fudge
     factor got inserted to make it go faster. At one time on one
     (old and slow) machine this made the output scroll at a speed
     comparable to a real 19200 bps connection. It hasn't been retuned
     since. This doesn't matter that much, but it's not actually the
     right speed for a serial console.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
There is also the issue that System/161 cannot actually execute 25
million instructions a second, even on a fast machine. Therefore, on
CPU-intensive tasks, it falls behind. In order to maintain the
illusion that it continues to run at 25MHz, it distinguishes virtual
time (within the simulation) from wall time (outside the simulation).
All internal timings are calculated in virtual time.
</p>

<p>
Wall time is of interest, however, because the <em>interactive</em>
behavior of the system occurs in wall time. For this reason,
System/161 attempts to sync itself to wall time. For I/O-intensive
tasks its interactive behavior is time-correct; for CPU-intensive
tasks it is very slow.  In the transition from one to the other some
odd artifacts can occur; these can be made odder yet by scheduling
interactions with the host OS if running on a busy system. These are
most noticeable on the system console, but can also occur if one is
using the virtual network.
</p>

<p>
For this reason, it's important to be cautious about evaluating
software performance by eyeball; appearances can be quite
misleading. Use the internal timers. If there's something you need to
do that the internal timers can't support, please file a bug report.
</p>

<p>
Currently, when multiple CPUs are configured, they execute in lockstep
in a single host-level thread, and the timing model is unchanged. It
is likely in the future that it will become possible to run each
virtual CPU on its own host-level thread; this will add major
complications to the timing model, the full ramifications of which are
not yet completely clear.
